This was preceded by several days of \\ntachypnea and increased work of breathing. Adequate gas exchange \\nwas achievable with minimal ventilator settings. She received \\nintermittent fentanyl boluses for ventilator dyssynchrony. \\nSerial ABGs were obtained to optimize her vent settings. She was \\ngradually weaned to CPAP. On ___ she was able to pass a \\nspontaneous breathing trial with low RSBI, however her NIF was \\n-23. Repeat CXR on ___ demonstrated mild worsening of a LLL \\nopacity concerning for a pneumonia and her sputum culture at \\nthat time showed GNR on gram stain and she was started on \\nCefepime for a VAP for a ___ue to severe muscular \\nweakness she was not able to be extubated until ___. She did \\nwell after extubation and was tolerating room air with O2 Sat > \\n97%, breathing comfortably and speaking full sentences, without \\ntrouble swallowing. \\n\\n# Fever\\nPatient was pancultured (bacterial and fungal) at multiple \\npoints during her hospital stay with no organism isolated. \\nMultiple CT abdomen/pelvis scans failed to reveal any evidence \\nof surgical site infection or other intraabdominal process and \\nno erythema or frank pus was observed on physical exam at any \\npoint during her stay. A transthoracic echo did not reveal any \\nvegetations. A lumbar puncture was attempted on ___ but no CSF \\ncould be obtained. Initially, there was no clinical or \\nradiographic evidence of PNA. Her urinalysis and urine culture \\nwere negative. The patient developed a rash initially affecting \\nher RUE and LLE, but later spreading more diffusely. Workup was \\nnegative for vascultiic or rheumatologic processes (see attached \\nlabs).\\n\\nDermatology was consulted and performed a skin biopsy of her \\nrash (___) which revealed neutrophilic infiltration in the \\ndermis and subcutaneous tissue thought to be consistent with \\nSweet's syndrome versus Bowel associated deramatosis-arthritis \\nsyndrome which is associated with IBD.   Rheumatology was also \\nconsulted and dermatology and rheumatology both recommended \\ntreatment with steroids. Viral and fungal causes for the \\npatient's symptoms were considered and tests for HIV, HCV, \\nHSV/VZV, and beta-glucan were all negative. Aspergillus \\ngalactomannan antigen was in the indeterminate range. A repeat \\nskin biopsy of her rash on ___ was consistent with the prior \\nbiopsy with the exception of increased infiltration of \\nneutrophils in the tissues, and a diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome \\nwas obtained. She was started on Methylprednisone 125mg for 3 \\ndays then transitioned to Prednisone 60mg daily for 3 days, \\nfollowed by a slow taper per Dermatology recommendations.\\n\\nIn terms of antimicrobial treatment, the patient was initially \\nstarted on IV vancomycin and zosyn. C.difficile coverage was \\nadded with IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin when her clinical status \\nworsened despite antibiotics. Her antimicrobials were later \\nbroadened to meropenam, doxycycline, acyclovir and fluconazole. \\nFlagyl and PO vancomycin were d/c\\x92d once her C.difficile PCR \\ntest returned negative. By ___, all antimicrobials and other \\nnon-essential medications were discontinued due to concern over \\niatrogenic drug fever. She remained afebrile after steroid \\nadministration for approximately 24 hours after which, she had \\nrecurrent fevers. Her Buspar was discontinued as a potential \\ncause for fevers. She was pan-cultured as no prior cultures were \\npositive to date. Her foley was changed out and her CVL was \\ndiscontinued. An endotracheal sputum sample was sent on ___ that \\nrevealed GNRs on gram stain and she was started on Cefepime to \\ntreat a potential VAP. A CXR revealed a possible left lower lobe \\npneumonia. A RUQ U/S was obtained due to mildly elevated Alk \\nPhos, lipase, and GGT which was unable to visualize the \\ngallbladder, the CBD was normal and there was no ductal \\ndilation.  She defevesced after initiation of cefepime without \\nrecurrence of her fevers.\\n\\n# Altered mental status\\nThe patient's mental status fluctuated significantly throughout \\nher admission. She was alert and conversant for the first \\nseveral days, however by ___ she was breathing spontaneously \\nbut unresponsive. Differential diagnosis included \\nmedication-induced changes (possibly ___ to CNS accumulation of \\nantibiotics due to renal dysfunction) vs status epilepticus. An \\nEEG demonstrated diffuse slowing concerning for \\nbacterial/viral/chemical/toxic encephalopathy but no evidence of \\nepileptiform activity. Hepatic encephalopathy was considered, \\nhowever a right upper quadrant ultrasound showed no evidence of \\ncirrhosis. The patient also developed hyponatremia to 125 which \\nwas believed to be due to hypervolemia secondary to acute renal \\nfailure. Due to concern regarding hyponatremia as the cause of \\nthe patient's AMS, the nephrology service was consulted and \\nrecommended diuresis. This was started on ___ and resulted in \\nadequate diruesis and her hyponatremia resolved. Once off \\nantibiotics and being started on steroids, on ___, her mental \\nstatus improved slowly and she was alert and following commands \\nby the time of discharge.\\n\\n# Acute Kidney Injury/ATN\\nPatient's creatinine on admission was 3.0, most likely due to \\npre-renal ___ secondary to low effective circulating volume due \\nto sepsis physiology. Agressive fluid resuscitation resulted in \\na downtrending creatinine to 1.8 on ___. From that point, \\nhowever, her creatinine trended up to 5.2 on ___. Urine \\nsediment revealed casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis, \\nmost likely due to a combination of tubular ischemia while \\nhypotensive and volume depleted, and the nephrotoxic effects of \\nthe antibiotics she received. Her creatinine peaked at 5.7, and \\nshe began making some urine. Nephrology was consulted to assist \\nwith management. She was given escalating doses of lasix with \\ngood diuresis and then as her renal function improved she began \\nauto-diuresing. On ___ her sodium level began trending up to 148 \\nand her free water flushes were increased. Her sodium continued \\nto trend up to 154 (corrected level 158) and she was started on \\na D5W drip. Her sodium levels were monitored closely and they \\ntrended down.  All of her electrolytes were normal, including \\nher creatinine at time of discharge.\\n\\n# Hyperglycemia\\nHer blood sugars were closely monitored. Once she began steroid \\ntherapy and tube feeds were initiated, her blood sugars became \\nelevated to the 300's. She was initially on a humalog sliding \\nscale which was changed to a regular sliding scale, followed by \\nan insulin drip on ___. She will be discharged to rehab with an \\ninsulin sliding scale.\\n\\n# Portal Vein Thrombosis\\nAt the time of her admission, the patient was being treated for \\na portal vein thrombosis that had been identified after her \\ncolectomy around 3 weeks prior. She was treated with a heparin \\ndrip throughout the course of her hospital stay. Some concern \\nfor an infected clot was raised, however no thrombus was \\nidentified on repeat CT imaging of her abdomen/pelvis and \\nultrasound revealed patent portal vein and her heparin drip was \\ndiscontinued.  She was not discharged on systemic \\nanticoagulation.\\n\\n# Sick Euthyroid Syndrome with underlying Hashimotos Thyroiditis\\nTFTs drawn on ___ were concerning for sick euthyroid syndrome \\nin the setting of severe critical illness, superimposed on \\nknown, biopsy-proven ___'s thyroiditis. TSH was 0.042, T3 \\nwas 46 and T4 was 3.0. These were slightly improved on ___, \\nwith TSH of 0.072, T3 45 and T4 of 3.6. No further workup for \\nhyperthyroidism was performed as her TFTs were likely reflective \\nof sick euthyroid syndrome in the setting of her acute illness. \\nThey should be repeated as an outpatient.\\n\\n#Anxiety\\nHome medication for anxiety included Xanex and Buspar. Buspar \\nwas felt to contribute to temperatures and altered mental status \\nduring hospitalization. Psychiatry was consulted to recommend \\nalternative treatment for anxiety. They felt that she would be \\nbest served with 0.5mg lorezapam 4 times per day PRN. She should \\nfollow up with home prescriber as an outpatient. \\n\\n#Transitional issues\\n1. Recheck TFTs in 4 weeks and work-up as needed; \\n2. Recheck Na daily at ___ to ensure normonatremia until \\nstable, if stable x2-3 days can check weekly\\n3. Adjust insulin sliding scale prn with prednisone taper\\n4. Continue to hold buspar until follow-up with outpatient \\npsychiatrist\\n5. Taper prednisone as follows: Day # ___ is day 1 of 5 of pred \\n50, please taper down by 10 mg every 5 days and then down to 5 \\nmg daily x 5 days, then stop\\n6.

Prior to that, there were some cognitive concerns and a\\nrecent diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia in ___. Since\\nthen she has been living with her daughter - who is present at\\nthe bedside to report the following history.\\nMs. ___ current troubles began with shortness of breath\\nand trouble lying flat to sleep ~3 months ago. She complained of\\npain in her chest and difficulty breathing when flat. Donepezil,\\nwhich had been started for AD, was entertained as a cause and\\nthis was discontinued with no improvement in symptoms. Ms.\\n___ became progressively sleepier and sleepier during the\\ndays, exacerbating her already present cognitive difficulties. \\nIn the last 2 months, she began to developed slurred speech and\\ndysphagia. At first her trouble was with thin liquids \\n(aspiration\\nshown on a Barium swallow study) which has now progressed to\\ndifficulty swallowing solids as well. She has been evaluated by\\nENT and Pulmonology for her swallowing and respiratory concerns,\\nwithout definitive diagnosis. \\nHer daughter also reports progressive weakness, more pronounced\\nin the upper extremities. Ms. ___ has difficulty with her\\nhands - opening jars and buttoning clothes. Her daughter also\\nreports that the family noticed fasciculations in the BUEs and\\nneck last ___ when Ms. ___ was wearing short sleeve\\nshirts.\\nMs. ___ was evaluated in cognitive neurology clinic by Dr.\\n___ on the day of presentation. He was concerning by her\\nprogressive picture, which seems most consistent with ALS.\\n\\n \\nPast Medical History:\\n- recent diagnosis of Alzheimer's type dementia\\n- recent sleep study: no REM sleep\\n- recent barium swallow: aspiration with thin liquids\\n- overactive bladder\\n \\nSocial History:\\n___\\nFamily History:\\nNC\\n \\nPhysical Exam:\\nADMISSION EXAM:\\nVS T97.2 HR85 BP125/73 RR28 Sat95RA\\nGEN - elderly woman, head drooped, slurred speech\\nHEENT - NC/AT, MMM, no ptosis\\nNECK - weakness of neck flexors 4+/5, extensors strong\\nCV - RRR\\nRESP - moderately increased WOB with accessory muscle use, no\\nretractions, mild tachypnea to RR max of 31\\nABD - soft, NT, ND\\nEXTR - atraumatic, WWP\\n\\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:\\nMS - Awakes to voice, but will fall asleep without verbal\\nstimulation. Oriented to self and date. Knows she is in a\\nhospital but cannot recall the name. Speech is extremely slurred\\nand difficult to understand, but there do not appear to be\\nlanguage deficits. Further MS testing is compromised by\\ndifficulty understanding speech. Voice is hypophonic and\\nenunciation of guttural sounds is quite compromised. No evidence\\nof apraxia or neglect.\\n\\nCN - VFF to confrontation. PERRL. EOMI. No ptosis. No reported\\ndiplopia. Facial sensation intact to LT. Face is symmetric at\\nrest and with activation - though there does appear to be\\nbilateral bulbar muscle weakness. Hearing intact to voice. \\nPalate\\nwith minimal excursion. Hypophonia with relatively more\\ncompromised guttural sounds (haha, gaga). SCMs and traps full\\npower. Tongue with global atrophy.\\n\\nMOTOR - Normal bulk. +Fasciculations in the BUEs (delts) and \\nneck\\nmuscles. BUEs with deltoid (___), tricep (4+/5) weakness. L ECR\\nand FEx are 4+/5. BLEs appear grossly full strength, with the\\nexception of 4+/5 at bilateral IPs.\\n\\nSENSORY - Grossly intact to LT and temperature throughout.\\n\\nREFLEXES - Markedly hyperreflexive throughout. 3+ at BUEs and\\npatellars. +Pec jerks bilaterally. Toes are down going\\nbilaterally.\\n\\nCOORD - No gross evidence of truncal or appendicular ataxia.\\n\\nGAIT - Rises unassisted, steadier than expected. Able to take \\nfew\\nsteps unaided.\\n\\n \\nPertinent Results:\\n___ CT Head\\n1. No acute intracranial process. \\n2. Moderate to severe age related involutional changes and \\nmoderate small \\nvessel ischemic changes. \\n\\n___ CXR\\nLow lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  \\nElevated left \\nhemidiaphragm with gas distended stomach and bowel beneath.  \\nBibasilar \\natelectasis. \\n\\n___ EMG\\nAbnormal study. Together with the clinical presentation, the \\nelectrophysiologic findings are most consistent with a \\ngeneralized disorder of motor neurons or their axons, as can be \\nseen in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, chronic and \\nongoing left cervical and lumbosacral polyradiculopathies cannot \\nbe entirely excluded. \\nThere is incidental evidence for a median neuropathy at the left \\nwrist, as in carpal tunnel syndrome. \\nResults of repetitive nerve stimulation and short exercise \\ntesting point away from a disorder of neuromuscular transmission \\nsuch as myasthenia ___.  \\n \\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nMs. ___ was admitted to the neurology service for workup of \\nneuromuscular disorder as above.\\n\\nShe was admitted to the stepdown unit, however in the morning \\nappeared sleepy, with head drop, tachypnea and ABG showing \\nhypercarbia to the ___ and hypoxia to the ___. She was \\ntransferred to the ICU for BiPAP.\\n\\nICU COURSE:\\nNo EMG was available on the weekend, and so while in the ICU, \\ntensilon test was performed to look for signs of myasthenia \\n___. This was positive - neck flexion improved as did eye \\nclosure strength, although speech remained hypophonic. She was \\nthen started on mestinon and was uptitrated. A pheresis line was \\nplaced and the patient received 2 sessions of PLEX. She was \\nintermittently on and off BiPAP, with repeated ABGs that showed \\ncontinued hypoxia and hypercarbia. She started developing skin \\nbreakdown on her nose from the BiPAP mask, which was treated \\nwith wound care.\\n\\nEMG was performed (see results section), which established a \\ndiagnosis of ALS. The tensilon test can be positive in the \\nsetting of ALS and certain other neurological disorders. \\nMestinon and plasma exchange were discontinued. After discussion \\nwith the family, the patient was made DNR/DNI.\\n\\nThe patient was acutely worse on the morning of ___, with \\nsomnolence that did not improve with BiPAP. After further \\ndiscussion with the family and palliative care consult, the \\ndecision was made to focus on comfort care. She was transferred \\nout of the ICU.\\n\\nIn reviewing her outside MRI, her diagnosis of dementia is more \\nlikely frontotemporal dementia, which can be associated with \\nALS, rather than Alzheimer's dementia.\\n\\n___ passed away on ___ at 0143AM. She had absent\\npupillary responses, no pulses, and she did not have any heart \\nor\\nbreath sounds. Her daughter was at the bedside, and she elected\\nnot to pursue an autopsy. The PCP was notified, and the death\\ncertificate was signed. \\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\\n1. trospium 20 mg oral BID \\n\\n \\nDischarge Medications:\\nN/A\\n \\nDischarge Disposition:\\nExpired\\n \\nDischarge Diagnosis:\\nALS\\n \\nDischarge Condition:\\nDeceased\\n \\nDischarge Instructions:\\nN/A\\n \\nFollowup Instructions:\\n___\\n\"]\n",

On morning of \\nadmission, the patient's blood cultures returned positive with \\ngram positive with GPCs. The patient was started broadly on \\nantibiotics with Vancomycin and Zosyn upon admission. \\nRheumatology was consulted on the morning of admission and \\ntapped the patient's left wrist. Gram stain returned showing \\nlarge amount of Gram positive cocci. Plastic surgery became \\ninvolved and tapped the patient's right wrist and right hallux \\nwhich also showed evidence of septic joint with large amount of \\nGram positive cocci. ID was consulted ___ light of the patient's \\nhigh-grade bacteremia. TTE that was done did not show evidence \\nof vegetations. ___ light of her polyarticular septic joints, the \\npatient was planned to be taken to the OR for joint wash-outs. \\nHowever, as the patient was being wheeled for her procedures, \\nshe developed large-volume hematemesis and was subsequently \\nintbuated for airway protection and concern for aspiration. \\nHepatology performed a bedside EGD and found bleeding, within \\nthe esophagus, stomach. The patient received 4 units of blood \\nand 1 unit of FFP ___ the setting of her acute GI bleed. \\nInterventional Radiology attempted embolization ___ light of the \\nacute GI bleed, but the procedure was aborted secondary to \\ndissection. The patient acutely stabilized. A repeat EGD on ___ \\nshowed evidence of ischemic gastritis with large ulcerations \\npresent ___ the esophagus, stomach, and duodenal bulb. The \\npatient had epinephrine injections and one clip placed where a \\nvessel was visible. Of note, because of the patient's ___, the \\npatient was started on CVVH as well. Because of the patient's \\nclinical instability and three-pressor requirement, Plastic \\nsurgery performed serial bedside taps of the involved joints at \\nthe bedside. Joint aspiration fluid and blood cultures returned \\nwith Staph aureus, and antibiotics were narrowed to Vancomcyin \\nfrom Vancomycin and Zosyn.\\n\\nThrough the patient's admission, the patient's family was \\nupdated regarding her clinical status. ___ light of her clinical \\ncourse, a family meeting was held during which the decision was \\nmade to transition the patient to comfort measures only on ___. CVVH and pressors were discontinued. The patient was \\nnot extubated, but ventilator settings were modified ___ a way to \\nmimic atmospheric conditions.
